When it was established approximately 40 years ago there was much optimism about the ability of African nations to solve the problems of Africa by themselves. The OAU was not able to realise this and was disbanded by its member states during the past week. It is replaced by the African Union, which has been launched with a new set of rules for managing the progress on the continent. While the OAU was established to fight colonialism, apartheid and foreign interference, the AU will concentrate on human rights, democracy, good governance and development. </para>
